# Manga Title Processing System

This system consists of two Python scripts that help manage and compare manga titles from different sources.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. manga_parser.py
Processes manga data from JSON files and maintains a library of titles.

**Features:**
- Reads manga data from `mangas.json`
- Extracts English and Japanese titles
- Saves formatted entries to `my_library.txt`
- Automatically archives processed JSON files
- Creates a new empty `mangas.json` after processing

**How to Use:**
1. Get your manga data:
   - Go to your MangaDex library page
   - Open browser's Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to the Network tab
   - Look for a request that starts with `manga?ids[]=`
   - Copy the response JSON data into `mangas.json`
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python manga_parser.py
   ```
3. The script will:
   - Process the manga data
   - Add entries to `my_library.txt`
   - Move the processed JSON to the `archives` folder
   - Create a new empty `mangas.json`

### 2. manga_compare.py
Compares titles between your library and a CSV file to find matches.

**Features:**
- Compares titles between `my_library.txt` and "The Mangadex Massacre - Sheet1.csv"
- Smart title matching that ignores articles ("The", "A", "An")
- Handles alternative titles and Japanese names
- Saves matches to `matching_titles.txt`

**How to Use:**
1. Ensure you have:
   - `my_library.txt` (generated by manga_parser.py)
   - "The Mangadex Massacre - Sheet1.csv" (your comparison source)
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python manga_compare.py
   ```
3. The script will:
   - Compare titles between both sources
   - Display matches in the console
   - Save matches to `matching_titles.txt`

## File Structure
```
.
├── manga_parser.py
├── manga_compare.py
├── mangas.json              # Your input JSON file
├── my_library.txt          # Generated library file
├── matching_titles.txt     # Generated matches file
├── The Mangadex Massacre - Sheet1.csv  # Your comparison source
└── archives/              # Directory for processed files
```

## Notes
- The system automatically handles file encoding (UTF-8) for proper Japanese character support
- Processed files are archived with timestamps to maintain history
- The comparison is case-insensitive and ignores common articles for better matching
- Alternative titles are considered during comparison to maximize matches
